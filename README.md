# eSim
Repository for my TEALs project, eSim. eSim is an evolution simulator designed to emulate, in a visual manner, the basic concepts behind machine learning. Developed by me, Bret Craig, and Teddy Arasavelli.

Controls:

  Menus:
   eSim controls are straightforward. All menu navigation is done with arrow keys, as well as the "enter" key to "click" something. There    are also several drop-down menus that can be expanded, including things (such as resolution options, for example). These drop-down        menus must be closed to make any changes. An in-depth description of what each option does is available below.
   
   
  Simulation:
    In the simulation, there are a variety of controls that need to be explained. 
    To move the camera, you can use the arrow keys or alternatively, WASD. You can also zoom in and out with a mouse wheel or trackpad as     you would normally.
    
    By clicking a creature, you will highlight the creature (a light-blue aura will surround it), and its relevant characteristics             (species name, attributes, etc.) will be visible in the top-left corner of a screen. If you double-click a creature, you will follow       it, and your camera will follow it as well. Alternatively, you can use the Q and E keys to navigate through creatures, and press "F"       to lock your camera to follow your selected creature.
    
    eSim also has time control available. To speed up time, press the "." key, and to slow it down, press the "," key on your keyboard. To     pause the simulation, you can press space or the "P" button.
